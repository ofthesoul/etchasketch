Etch-A-Sketch

A pixel art maker with several modes and fully custom grid sizing.

Getting Started

All you need is a modern web browser to play. 

Built With

Vanilla Javascript, HTML, and CSS.

Dev process:

Started out creating the grid with nested for loops before running into issues pretty quickly and moving to the CSS grid method. This method was vastly superior. After some tinkering i was able to make it so you could have literally any grid size, whether it be 20x20 or 3x80, and the overall grid size stays the same. From there i added a color button that goes through an intuitive ROYGBIV list of colors with the button changing colors to correspond with the selection, added a rainbow mode for that extra fun, and finally added a realistic graphite mode for darkening of cells when mousedover multiple times. I finished it off by adding an eraser which i quickly realized i needed :) and allowing the user to hit "enter" to submit the grid size rather than only being able to click submit. Finally, topped everything off by polishing the style and addding a fade-in animation all with pure css.
